          <p>A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For static content, just drop it into any
            page and begin editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then connect a rich

          <p>Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is
            added to the rich text element using the &quot;When inside of&quot; nested selector system.</p>
